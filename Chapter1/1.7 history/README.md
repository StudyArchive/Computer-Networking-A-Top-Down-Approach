## Internet history
### 1961-1972:Early packet-switching principles
- 1961 : Kleinrock - 'queueing theory' shows effectiveness of packet-swiching
- 1964: Baran - 'packet-switching' in military nets
- 1967: 'ARPAnet' conceived by Advanced Research Projects Agency
- 1969: first ARPAnet node operational
- 1972
 - ARPAnet public demo
 - NCP(Network Control Protocol) first host-host protocol
 - first e-mail program
 - ARPAnet has 15 nodes

### 1972-1980: Internetworking, new and proprietary nets(new various network)
- 1970: ALOHAnet satellite network in Hawaii
- 1974: Cerf and Kahn - architecture for interconnecting networks
- 1976: Ethernet at Xerox PARC
- late 70's: proprietary ahrchitecture: DECnet, SNA, XNA
- late 70's switching fixed legnth packet(ATM precursor)
- 1979: ARPnet has 200 nodes

#### Cerf and Kahn's internetworking principles:
- minimalism, autonomy - no internal changed requires to interconnect networks
- best effort service model(no guarantee)
- stateless routers(no record state information)
- decentralized control
=> defined today's Internet architecture

### 1980-1990: new protocols, a proliferation of networks
- 1983: deployment of TCP/IP
- 1982: smtp e-mail protocol defined
- 1983: DNS defined for name-to-IP-address translation
- 1985: FTP protocol defined
- 1988: TCP congestion control
- new national networks: Csnet, BITnet, NSFnet, Minitel
- 100,000 hosts connected to confederation of networks

### 1990, 2000's: commercialization, the Web, new apps
- early 1990's ARPAnet decommissioned
- 1991: NSFnet lifts restrictions on commercial use of NSFnet(decommissioned, 1995)
- early 190s: WEB
 - hypernext(Bush 1945, Nelson 1960's)
 - HTML, HTTP: Berners-Lee
 - 1994: Mosaic, later Netscape
 - late 1990's: commercialization of the Web
- late 1990's - 2000's:
 - more killer apps: instane messaging, P2P file sharing
 - network security to forefront
 - est. 50 million host, 100 million+ users
 - backbone linkes running at Gbps

 ### 2005~present
 - 750 million host
    - Smatphones and tablet
- Aggressive deployment of broadband access
- Increasing ubuiquity of high-speed wireless access
 - Emergence of online social networks
 - Service providers(Google, Microsoft) create their own networks(content provider network)
    - Bypass Internet, providing "instantaneous" access to search, email, etc
 - E-commerce, universities, enterprises runnign thier services in "cloud" (e.g. Amazon EC2)

 #### summary
 - 1961-1972: Inception of Internet
   - queueing theory and concept of packet swiching
   - ARPAnet, NCP, Email
- 1972-1980: Proliferation of various nets and Inetnetworking
- 1980-1990: Proliferation of protocols(TCP/IP, various application protocol), and networks(new natonal network espectially NSFnet)
- 1990 : Web and Commercialzation of Internet
- 2000 : Explision of Internet scale
 - security
 - application, user, host
- 2005-present
  - smartphones and tablets
  - ubiquitous deployment of wireless and broadband access
  - social networks, content provider networks, cloud service
